I am Yuling Jiang, a PhD student in Social Medicine and Health Policy at Peking University, where I am a member of the AgeLab under the supervision of Professor Yao Yao. My research centers on healthy aging and age-friendly environments. I specialize in applying epidemiological methods and statistical analysis—with proficiency in R and STATA—to study the determinants of healthy aging and to evaluate supportive policies for older adults.

I am driven by a strong interest in translating evidence into practical interventions that enhance the quality of life in aging populations. My prior research includes contributions to studies on health inequalities and the mental health of vulnerable groups. I am always open to discussing ideas and potential collaborations to further our understanding in this field. For more information about our lab, please visit https://agelab.pku.edu.cn/. I look forward to connecting and working with fellow researchers and professionals.
